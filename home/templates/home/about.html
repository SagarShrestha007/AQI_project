    About AQIntelX
  </h2>

  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
    <strong>AQIntelX</strong> stands for <strong>Air Quality Intelligence eXperience</strong>.
    It is a final-year project that integrates real-time air quality monitoring, machine learning-based prediction models, 
    and a user-friendly web interface to deliver accurate and actionable insights about air pollution.
  </p>

  <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; color: #34495e;">Data Source</h3>
  <p style="line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
    The system uses hardware sensors that continuously measure key environmental parameters, including 
    <strong>PM2.5</strong>, <strong>PM10</strong>, <strong>pressure</strong>, <strong>carbon monoxide (CO)</strong>, 
    <strong>temperature</strong>, and <strong>humidity</strong>. This data is uploaded in real time to cloud storage and 
    accessed by the system to ensure up-to-date readings.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
    The collected data is used to compute the current Air Quality Index (AQI), with a focus on PM2.5 and PM10, 
    which are the most significant pollutants affecting air quality.
  </p>

  <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; color: #34495e;">Machine Learning Models</h3>
  <p style="line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
    AQIntelX utilizes two CatBoost regression models, each trained for a specific location: <strong>Kathmandu</strong> 
    and <strong>Changunarayan</strong>. When users select a location, the corresponding model predicts the AQI for that area.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
    For model training, historical air quality and weather data were gathered from three APIs: 
    <strong>PurpleAir</strong>, <strong>OpenAQ</strong>, and <strong>OpenWeather</strong>. These diverse datasets provided 
    a strong foundation to train and validate the models effectively.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
    Predictions are presented through interactive graphs and clear explanations, making the information accessible and easy to interpret.
  </p>

  <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; color: #34495e;">Additional Insights</h3>
  <p style="line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
    Although multiple environmental parameters are measured, AQI calculations and predictions emphasize PM2.5 and PM10 
    due to their significant health impacts.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
    The website also includes educational content that explains how each parameter relates to air quality and health, 
    helping users understand the importance of these readings.
  </p>

  <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; color: #34495e;">Web Interface</h3>
  <p style="line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
    The AQIntelX web application was <strong>designed in Figma</strong> and <strong>developed using Django</strong>. 
    It features a clean and intuitive interface where users can select their location, view live sensor data, 
    explore AQI forecasts, and gain meaningful insights â€” all in one place.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
    This project helps people make more informed, healthier decisions by providing reliable, easy-to-understand 
    information about the air they breathe.
